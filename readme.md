This is my first repository by my own and I'm sharing all my C++ exercises.

Below, the description of what each exercise proposes:

Examples using IF ELSE:

35 - Calculate the final value of the rented car, considerating it's type, how much kms it traveled, and for how many days;

36 - Calculate how much money a person can make by doing physical exercises;

37 - Calculate the salary readjustment considerating the gender and how many years is the employee working at the company;

Examples using WHILE

38 - Counting from 6 to 10;

39 - Counting from 10 to 3;

40 - Couting from 0 to 18, skyp counting by 3;

41 - Counting from 100 to 0, skyp couting by 5;

42 - Counting asking the user how much he wants to count;

43 - A countdown from 30 to 0, highlighting the numbers divisibles by 4;

44 - A algorithm that ask the user 2 values and the increment he wants to use to count (*45 asks to solve the problem if the first value is higher than the second);
